# DSLR: Data Science × Logistic Regression

In this project DSLR, we'll implement from the scratch a linear classification model: a logistic regression.
• We'll read a data set from a file, visualize it in different ways, select and clean unnecessary information from the data.
• We'll train a logistic regression model that will solve a classification problem.
