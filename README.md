# DSLR: Data Science × Logistic Regression

In this project DSLR, we will implement a linear classification model: a logistic regression, from the scratch.
• We'll read a data set, visualize it in different ways, select and clean unnecessary information from the data.
• We'll train a logistic regression model that will solve a classification problem.
