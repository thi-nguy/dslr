# DSLR: Data Science × Logistic Regression

In this project DSLR, we'll implement from the scratch a linear classification model: a logistic regression.
• We'll read a data set from a file, visualize it in different ways, select and clean unnecessary information from the data.
• We'll train a logistic regression model that will solve a classification problem.

How to run the project:
- Create virtual environment for the project: `python3 -m venv your_env_name`
- Activate the environment: `source your_env_name/bin/activate`
- Install needed libraries (mostly for displaying graph): `pip install matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn`
- Run program: `python3 file_name.py dataset_path.csv`
